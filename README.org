* Yet another AngularJS Openweathermap widget

  This is a lightweight [[http://openweathermap.org/][openweathermap]] widget for [[https://angularjs.org][AngularJS]] which uses the
  [[https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons][weather-icons]].

** Screenshot

** External components

   This is based on the following components:

   - [[http://getbootstrap.com/][bootstrap]] 3.3.5
   - [[http://angularjs.org][AngularJS]] 1.3.16
   - [[https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons][weather-icons]] 2.0.1

   They are included in the external directory.

** Usage

   The following displays a similar block to the screenshot:

   #+begin_src html
   <ya-openweathermap city-name="London" api-key="...."></ya-openweathermap>
   #+end_src

   The parameter /city-name/ is the city-name which will be given to the
   openweathermap api. The /api-key/ is the key that you receive when you
   register your app to the openweathermap service.

   See the example.html for specific details.
